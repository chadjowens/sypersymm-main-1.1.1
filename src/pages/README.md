# Pages

This directory contains page components for the SyperSymmetry project.

## Purpose
Page components represent the top-level views that are rendered for specific routes in the application. They typically compose multiple components to create complete page layouts and handle page-specific logic.

## Naming Convention
Page files should:
- Use PascalCase for component names and filenames
- Have descriptive names that indicate their purpose (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`, `ServicePage.tsx`)
- End with `Page.tsx` suffix
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## When to Add Files
Add new page files to this directory when:
- You're implementing a new route in the application
- You're refactoring an existing view into a dedicated page component
- You're creating a new section of the application that requires its own URL

## Directory Structure
Pages can be organized in several ways:
- Flat structure for simple applications
- Nested directories for complex applications with many pages
- Feature-based organization for related pages

## Best Practices
- Keep page components focused on composition and routing
- Extract reusable UI elements to the components directory
- Use layouts from the layouts directory for consistent page structure
- Implement proper route handling and navigation
- Document the purpose and usage of each page
- Consider code-splitting for performance optimization
- Use TypeScript props interfaces for page properties

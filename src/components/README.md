# Components

This directory contains React components for the SyperSymmetry project.

## Purpose
The components directory houses reusable UI components that make up the application interface. These components follow a component-based architecture to promote reusability, maintainability, and consistency.

## Naming Convention
Component files should:
- Use PascalCase for component names and filenames
- Have descriptive names that indicate their functionality
- End with `.tsx` extension
- Group related components in subdirectories when appropriate

## Directory Structure
Components can be organized in several ways:
- By feature (e.g., `/auth`, `/dashboard`)
- By component type (e.g., `/layout`, `/form`, `/display`)
- By page section (e.g., `/hero`, `/services`, `/contact`)

## When to Add Files
Add new component files to this directory when:
- You're creating a new UI element that will be used in the application
- You're refactoring existing UI code into reusable components
- You're implementing a new feature that requires custom UI components

## Best Practices
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript props interfaces for component properties
- Implement proper prop validation
- Document components with JSDoc comments
- Consider component composition over complex single components
- Use React hooks for stateful logic
- Follow the project's styling conventions (TailwindCSS)
- Create subdirectories for related components when the number of files grows

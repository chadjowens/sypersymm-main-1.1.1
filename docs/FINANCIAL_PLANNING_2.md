# Financial Planning 2.0 - Architecture and Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Financial Planning 2.0 page is a redesigned approach to the interactive financial planning presentation. This document outlines the architecture, component structure, and implementation guidelines for the new page.

## Goals

- Create a clean, maintainable slide presentation system
- Implement intuitive navigation between slides
- Ensure responsive design for all device sizes
- Reduce complexity and debugging overhead
- Improve code organization with clear separation of concerns
- Support easy content updates and additions

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **FinancialPlanningPage**
   - Top-level page component
   - Handles routing and page layout
   - Renders the SimpleNavbar and SlideContainer

2. **SlideContainer**
   - Manages slide state and navigation
   - Provides context for current slide position
   - Renders the current slide and navigation controls
   - Handles keyboard navigation and swipe gestures

3. **Slide Components**
   - Individual, self-contained slide content
   - Each slide is a separate component with its own content
   - Slides receive common props for consistent styling and behavior

4. **NavigationControls**
   - Separate component for navigation UI
   - Includes slide indicators and next/previous buttons
   - Receives navigation callbacks from SlideContainer

### Data Flow

```
FinancialPlanningPage
  ├── SimpleNavbar
  └── SlideContainer
      ├── Current Slide Component
      └── NavigationControls
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### State Management

- Use React's Context API for slide state management
- Maintain slide position in the SlideContainer component
- Pass navigation functions down to child components via props or context

### Navigation

- Support keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- Implement touch swipe gestures for mobile devices
- Provide visual indicators for current slide position
- Include accessible navigation controls

### Styling

- Use CSS modules or styled components for component-specific styles
- Maintain consistent styling across all slides
- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
- Support both light and dark themes

### Code Organization

- Place all slide components in `src/components/financial-planning/slides/`
- Keep navigation components in `src/components/financial-planning/navigation/`
- Store shared types in `src/types/financial-planning.ts`
- Use barrel exports for clean imports

## Routing

Add a new route in App.tsx:

```tsx
<Route path="/financial-planning-2" element={<FinancialPlanningPage />} />
```

## Progressive Enhancement

1. **Phase 1: Basic Implementation**
   - Create page structure and basic navigation
   - Implement first few slides with static content
   - Set up routing and layout

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Interaction**
   - Add animations and transitions between slides
   - Implement interactive elements within slides
   - Add keyboard and touch navigation

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
   - Add progress saving (remember last viewed slide)
   - Implement analytics tracking
   - Add print/export functionality

## Best Practices

1. **Component Structure**
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments

2. **Performance**
   - Lazy load slides that aren't immediately visible
   - Optimize images and animations
   - Use React.memo for components that don't need frequent re-renders

3. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
   - Add proper ARIA attributes to all interactive elements
   - Test with screen readers

## Differences from Previous Implementation

The new implementation improves upon the previous version by:

1. **Cleaner State Management**
   - Using React Context instead of prop drilling
   - Reducing unnecessary re-renders

2. **Better Code Organization**
   - Separating navigation logic from slide content
   - Creating a more modular component structure

3. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Adding keyboard and touch navigation
   - Improving transitions between slides
   - Supporting better accessibility

4. **Simplified Debugging**
   - Removing excessive console logs
   - Using proper error boundaries
   - Implementing cleaner state updates

## Getting Started

To begin implementing the Financial Planning 2.0 page:

1. Create the directory structure
2. Implement the base page component
3. Create the slide container and navigation components
4. Add the first slide component
5. Set up routing in App.tsx

# Project Planning Document

## Project Overview
SyperSymmetry appears to be a modern AI agency website that showcases various technology and AI-related services. The project is a single-page application (SPA) with multiple service-specific layouts and sections including a hero section, services overview, about section, and contact functionality.

## Project Scope
- Interactive website with modern UI/UX design
- Multiple service offerings presentation
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Dark/light mode theming
- Contact and scheduling integration
- Service-specific detailed pages
- Background animations and visual effects

## Technical Architecture
The application follows a modern React-based architecture with a progressive implementation approach:

### Core Components
- Main Layout Structure
  - Hero Section
  - Services Section
  - About Section
  - Contact Section
- Service-Specific Layouts
  - AI Development
  - MVP Development
  - Full Stack Development
  - UX/UI Design
  - Data Visualization
  - AI Creative Services
- Shared Components
  - Navigation
  - Background Effects
  - Animated Separators
  - Error Boundary

### State Management
- Zustand for global state management
- React Router for navigation
- Component-level state for local UI interactions

### Progressive Implementation Approach
The project follows a phased implementation approach where:

1. **Phase 1: Core Structure**
   - Implement core directories and files
   - Set up basic UI components and layouts
   - Establish styling foundation with TailwindCSS

2. **Phase 2: Feature Implementation**
   - Add routing with React Router (creates src/pages)
   - Implement service-specific layouts (creates src/layouts)
   - Add utility functions as needed (creates src/utils)

3. **Phase 3: Integration**
   - Integrate Supabase for backend functionality (creates src/services)
   - Implement contact form and authentication
   - Add context providers as needed (creates src/context)

4. **Phase 4: Testing & Optimization**
   - Implement testing framework (creates tests directory)
   - Add performance optimizations
   - Create static assets for production (creates public directory)

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js
- **Backend Integration**: Supabase
- **UI Components**: 
  - React-Calendly for scheduling
  - React-DatePicker for date selection
  - Lucide for icons
- **Development Tools**:
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - ESLint for code quality
  - PostCSS for CSS processing

## Security Considerations
1. **Data Protection**
   - Supabase integration for secure data handling
   - Environment variables for sensitive information
   - Client-side data validation

2. **Application Security**
   - Error boundaries for graceful error handling
   - Type safety with TypeScript
   - Protected routes where necessary

3. **API Security**
   - Secure API endpoints
   - Rate limiting considerations
   - CORS policy implementation

## Performance Goals
1. **Loading Performance**
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.5s
   - Time to Interactive (TTI) < 3.0s
   - First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms

2. **Runtime Performance**
   - Smooth animations (60fps)
   - Optimized 3D rendering
   - Efficient state updates

3. **Code Quality**
   - TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - ESLint rules adherence
   - Component reusability

## Deployment Strategy
1. **Build Process**
   - Vite-based build pipeline
   - Asset optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Tree shaking

2. **Deployment Options**
   - Static site deployment
   - CDN integration
   - Environment-specific configurations

3. **Monitoring**
